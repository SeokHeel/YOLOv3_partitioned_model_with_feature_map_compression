Mon, 25 Mar 2019 14:57:00 WARNING From E:/KETI/YOLOv3_code/train.py:142: map_and_batch (from tensorflow.contrib.data.python.ops.batching) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.data.experimental.map_and_batch(...)`.
Mon, 25 Mar 2019 14:57:00 WARNING From E:/KETI/YOLOv3_code/train.py:141: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, use
    tf.py_function, which takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
